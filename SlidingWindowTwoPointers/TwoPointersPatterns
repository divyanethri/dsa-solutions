Two pointer/ Sliding Window

There are 4 types/ patterns of sliding window problems

1. Constant Window, where we get k as constant window
2. Longest Subarray/ Substring where <Condition> -> BruteForce, Better, Optimal
3. Number of Subarrays where <Condition> -> totally based on the pattern two.
4. Shortest/ Minimum Window <Condition> 


3. Example 
  Number of Subarrays with sum = k,
  When there's a constant condition then we can't decide whether to shrink or expand.

  Number of Subarrays where sum<= k          = x 
  Number of Subarrays where sum <= (k-1)     = y 

  do (x - y)

4. When you get the valid window, then you just shrink the windoww without touching the right pointer.
